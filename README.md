## Paper in progress
•	Using ML (Neural Networks) implementations to research new applications in the field of engineering. 
•	Working with wide range of datasets from business analytics to raw data.
•	Currently on working on paper (preparing for submission in M21scientific journal), I implemented over 40 ML models for time-series data (Failure rate λ(t)) from real-life system and# classify types of faliar based on their length. 
•	Best model outperformed previous best statistical prediction by 73% as of now.
